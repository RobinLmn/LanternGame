# LanternGame
Monthly Game Jam project, theme: lantern

we have to find a name :)

Code : 

PlayerController : (Movement)
Inspired by Brackey's tuto on 2D Movement in Unity, I think it's pretty good

Interactable :
I just retook the one we made in the bootcamp that was great. It will allow us to add features in the puzzles like levers
or boxes that you can move or I don't know
 
Camera Controller:
I made the camera follow the player, but I don't think it looks great so we could think of a cool camera effect
 -->Â What should the camera be doing ?
 
To do : 
 
Character design 
Animation of the character
 
Find a way to implement the lantern bc it's the key feature of the game sooooo...

Environment
Creating the puzzles 

User interface
